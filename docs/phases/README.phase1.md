# Phase 1: Environment Setup

**Tasks Completed:**
- **GitHub Repository Creation:** The official repository was created and initialized.
- **Composer Initialization:** `composer.json` was set up with the project's core dependencies and autoloading configurations.
- **Environment Configuration:** A `.env.example` file was created to provide a template for environment-specific variables.
- **PHPUnit Setup:** The testing framework was configured with `phpunit.xml.dist` to ensure a consistent testing environment.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** The CI environment was prepared to automate testing and quality checks.
- **Autoloading Namespaces:** PSR-4 autoloading was configured for the `Maatify\SecurityGuard` namespace.

**Outputs:**
- `composer.json`
- `.env.example`
- `tests/bootstrap.php`
- `phpunit.xml.dist`
